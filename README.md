This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It uses the css library [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The compiled front end code is available on [https://beatsheet.vercel.app/](https://beatsheet.vercel.app/). To run the backend services, follow the instructions on the following repository to get a Docker container running locally (the front end app points to the local endpoint): [beatsheet-exercise](https://github.com/fmatar/beatsheet-exercise)

If you would rather run the code locally, follow the below instructions:
